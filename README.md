# vitamined mode line

â€¦is my attempt at a clear Emacs mode line. The layout/behavior is hardcoded;
I started [from this config](http://amitp.blogspot.fr/2011/08/emacs-custom-mode-line.html).
As for the appearance, it defines specific faces that are set in my `init.el`, using colors from
[a variant of the Solarized theme](https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-solarized).
