# vitamined mode line

â€¦is my attempt at a clear Emacs mode line. The layout/behavior is hardcoded;
I started from a couple [blog](http://amitp.blogspot.fr/2011/08/emacs-custom-mode-line.html)
[posts](http://www.lunaryorn.com/2014/07/26/make-your-emacs-mode-line-more-useful.html) on the topic.

As for the appearance, it defines specific faces that are set in my `init.el`, using colors from
[a variant of the Solarized theme](https://github.com/purcell/color-theme-sanityinc-solarized).
